# URL Shortener — DevCamp 2026 Frontend Assignment

---

## Part A: Getting Started

### About This Project

This is the **URL Shortener** frontend assignment for **DevCamp 2026 Frontend Training**. You will build a complete URL shortening web application — from UI to full API integration.

> **Note on CSS:** The tech stack below is recommended to make your Capstone project easier. However, you are **not required to strictly follow Tailwind CSS** — feel free to use your preferred CSS solution (e.g. CSS Modules, SCSS, styled-components, etc.).

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start development server
yarn dev

# Build for production
yarn build
```

---

### Commands to Know

| Command             | Description                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `yarn dev`          | Start local dev server at `http://localhost:5173` |
| `yarn build`        | Type-check + production build                     |
| `yarn lint`         | Run ESLint across the project                     |
| `yarn format`       | Auto-format source files with Prettier            |
| `yarn format:check` | Check formatting without writing (CI-friendly)    |
| `yarn preview`      | Serve the production build locally                |

---

### Pre-commit Rules

Every `git commit` automatically:

1. **Checks your branch name** — must follow the convention below
2. **Runs lint-staged** — formats and lints only staged files

**For Devmembers — your branch must be named after yourself:**

```
feature/<your_email>

```

**Examples:**
```
feature/john_doe@example.com
```

## Part B: Assignment

> Details and Figma file will be provided separately.

The assignment has **2 phases**:

### Phase 1 — Build the UI

Implement the application UI based on the provided **Figma design file**. Focus on:

- Pixel-accurate layout and components
- Clean component structure
- Using hooks and state management effectively
- Using TypeScript for type safety

### Phase 2 — API Integration

Connect your UI to the backend built in the **companion BE assignment** to create a complete working flow:

- Shorten a URL
- Redirect via short URL

## Part C: Requirements

### Must Have

| #   | Requirement             | Details                                                            |
| --- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | **Clean & accurate UI** | Follows the Figma design; easy to use and visually consistent      |
| 2   | **Input field**         | Accepts user input; handles focus state (focused/unfocused styles) |
| 3   | **Shorten button**      | Has hover and focus effects; clicking it opens a result modal      |
| 4   | **Copy button**         | Copies the shortened link to the user's clipboard                  |

### Nice to Have

| #   | Requirement              | Details                                                                                              |
| --- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Responsive UI**        | Layout adapts gracefully to different screen sizes                                                   |
| 2   | **Success notification** | Shows a notification/toast when a link is successfully shortened                                     |
| 3   | **BE integration**       | Full end-to-end flow connected to the backend API _(requires completing the BE training assignment)_ |

> **Note:** BE integration is **optional** and requires completing the companion Backend training assignment first.

## Part D: Grading Evaluation

| Criteria              | Description                                                                |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **UI**                | Visual accuracy compared to Figma, attention to detail                     |
| **Functionality**     | All must-have features work correctly (input, shorten button, copy button) |
| **Coding Style**      | Clean, readable code; consistent formatting; meaningful naming, utilize TypeScript effectively |
| **Project Structure** | Logical file/folder organization; separation of concerns                   |

> **Important:** BE integration is **not graded** and does **not count toward your score**. It exists purely as extra practice for students who complete the BE assignment. Only the UI and frontend functionality are evaluated.
